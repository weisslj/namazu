What is Namazu?

   Namazu is a search engine software intended for easy use.
   Not only it works as CGI program for a small or medium
   scale Web search engine, but also works as a personal use
   search system for your a pile of emails.

   Namazu is a free software under the terms of GPL2. Namazu
   is developed by Namazu Project. See `CREDITS' for more
   information about us. 

   At the beginning Namazu was made with only intention for
   Japanese use.  Now it can handle English and other latin
   languages encoded in ISO-8859-* character sets.  

   We Namazu Project has been trying to internationalize
   Namazu. At the moment, we have just only gettextized it.
   There is a lot of things to do. Please help us.

   You can find documentation in the `doc' directory. And
