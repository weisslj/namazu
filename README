Thanks for fishing Namazu! 
(The Japanese word `Namazu' means `catfish' in English)

What is Namazu?

   Namazu is a search engine software intended for easy use.  Not
   only it works as CGI program for small or medium scale WWW search
   engine, but also works as personal use such as search system for
   local HDD.  Now, search clients for Mule and Tcl/Tk, JAVA and
   Win32 are available.

Background Information

   At the beginning Namazu was made with only intention of
   Japanese use but now it has been developed to handle English
   (ASCII charset) and other languages defined in ISO-8859-*.

   I have a desire to distribute Namazu to all over the world but
   there are many problems on Internationalization. So perhaps
   using Namazu in non-Japanese environment is currently a little
   difficult. I am trying to improve now!

Notice

   Many documents and comments in source code are written in
   Japanese. I will translate that into English before long. 
   If I should get email from someone using Namazu from
   overseas, my motivation would rise :-).

   For same reason, contributed softwares written in Japanese will
   translate into English, maybe.

Request for comments

   My English skill is really horrible. If you notice mistakes in my
   writing, please teach me kindly :-).
