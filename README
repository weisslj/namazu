          Namazu a full text retrieval search system


What is Namazu?

   Namazu is a search engine software intended for easy use.
   Not only it works as a CGI program for a small or medium
   scale Web search engine, but also works as a personal use
   search system for your pile of emails.

   Namazu is a free software under the terms of the GNU
   General Public License version 2. See the file COPYING
   for more details.

   At the beginning Namazu was made with only intention for
   Japanese use.  Now it can handle English and other latin
   languages encoded in ISO-8859-* character sets.

   We have been trying to internationalize Namazu. At the
   moment, we have just only gettextized it.  There is a lot
   of things to do. Please help us.

   You can find documentation in the `doc' directory. And
   you can get the latest Namazu information at
