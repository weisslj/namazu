# This is a Namazu configuration file for namazu or namazu.cgi.
#
#   Originally, this file is named 'namazurc-sample'.  so you should
#   copy this to 'namazurc' to make the file effective.
#
#   Each item is must be separated by one or more SPACE or TAB characters. 
#   You can use a double-quoted string for represanting a string which 
#   contains one or more SPACE or TAB characters like "foo bar baz".
#
#     <List of Directives>
#
#       * Index
#         - Specify a default directory to search.
#
#       * Replace
#         - Replace a URI string in search results.
#           Specify TARGET REPLACEMENT by regular expression.
#           You can caputure strings by surrounding them with `(' and `)'
#           and use them later as backreferences by \1, \2, \3,... \9.
#
#           e.g.,
#
#              Replace  /home/foo/public_html/   http://www.foobar.jp/~foo/
#              Replace  /home/(.*)/public_html/  http://www.foobar.jp/\1/
#
#           If you do not want to do the replacement processing in 
#           command line use, you can run namazu with -U option.
#
#       * Logging 
#          - Set OFF to turn off keyword logging in NMZ.slog. 
#            Default: logging ON
#
#	* Lang
#          - Set a locale code such as `ja_JP.eucJP', `ja_JP.SJIS', 
#            `de', etc.  This directive works only if environment 
#            variable LANG is not set because the directive is mainly 
#            intended for CGI use.  On the shell, You can set 
#            environemtnt variable LANG instead of using the directive.
#
#            If you set `de' to it, namazu.cgi use 
#            NMZ.(head|foot|body|msg|tips).de for displaying results 
#            and use a proper message catalog for `de'.

#           files to compose search results.

#   which lacated under your home directory.  e.g.,
